This project is a number guessing game made with JavaFX. <br />
In this game the user choses the maximum bound for possible guesses. <br />
The game then guesses a random number within the range from 0 to the upper bound <br />
and the user tries to guess what it is. <br />
There is .jar and a packaged version of this project using jpackage in the out\artifacts\NumberGuess_jar file
